# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 1: April 22, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through the 'reverse string', 'triangle' and 'collatz conjecture' exercises on the Typescrip track on [exercism.io](https://exercism.io).

**Thoughts** It feels nice to start a new challenge that will get me coding everyday. The fact that I'm logging everything on Github and stream on Twitch is great for accountability.
