# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 1: April 22, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through the 'reverse string', 'triangle' and 'collatz conjecture' exercises on the Typescript track on [exercism.io](https://exercism.io).

**Thoughts** It feels nice to start a new challenge that will get me coding everyday. The fact that I'm logging everything on Github and stream on Twitch is great for accountability.

### Link(s) to work

1. [Reverse String](https://github.com/snowfrogdev/Exercism/tree/master/typescript/reverse-string)
2. [Triangle](https://github.com/snowfrogdev/Exercism/tree/master/typescript/triangle)
3. [Collatz Conjecture](https://github.com/snowfrogdev/Exercism/tree/master/typescript/collatz-conjecture)

## Day 2: April 23, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through the 'RNA Transcription' exercise on the Typescript track on [exercism.io](https://exercism.io). I've also worked on creating a small cli tool to generate Vanilla Typescript library starter code.

**Thoughts** The 'RNA Transcription' was a fun exercise. Though the problem was relatively easy to solve it gave me the opportunity to use some language features like `enum` and `type` that I haven't used much in the past.

I'm almost done with the first version of my cli tool. I'll add a bit of polish, refactor the code and then it'll be ready to publish to NPM.

## Day 3: April 24, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Solved the 'Ghost Legs' puzzle on [codingame.com](https://codingame.com). Polished my Vts CLI project and published it on NPM (vts-cli).

**Thoughts** An interesting puzzle to solze. It took me awhile to wrap my head around the problem space but once I figured a strategy to solve the problem it was relatively easy to solve. Spent almost 20 minutes refactoring afterwards to make it more readable.

I used [Gluegun](https://infinitered.github.io/gluegun/#/) to make the CLI tool and it was a real pleasure to use. Very easy to learn and quite powerful. I'm looking forward to automating alot of stuff with this little tool.

## Day 4: April 25, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Started working on the LUMEN puzzle on [codingame.com](https://codingame.com). Pushed version 1.1.0 of Vts-CLI to NPM. Added the option to setup a web project using parcel as a bundler.

**Thoughts** Ran into some weird problems with the way Rollup seemed to output my TS code. Will have to look into that.

## Day 5: April 26, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Solved the LUMEN puzzle on [codingame.com](https://codingame.com). Refactored some of Vts-CLI's code.

**Thoughts** Got a little lazy with the refactoring, but all in all I'm pleased with the solution I have used for this puzzle. Recursion for the win!

## Day 6: April 27, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Refactored the `new` command in Vts-CLI's using the Chain of Responsibility pattern.

**Thoughts** Implementing the CoR pattern was fun and I learned a lot. Hesitated between CoR and Builder pattern. Time will tell if I made the right choice.

## Day 7: April 28, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Made a mockup of QTsum, a Quentin Tarantino themed placeholder text generator inspired by [Jeffsum](https://jeffsum.com/) and started writing the html and css.

**Thoughts** I need to get better at CSS. It's the only tech where I seem to have a hard time remembering what does what. There's just so many options.

## Day 8: April 29, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Worked through the 'Protein translation', 'Nucleotide count and started the 'Allergies' exercises on [exercism.io](https://exercism.io).

**Thoughts** I had fun working on these relatively simple exercises. I ended learning about TS index signatures.
