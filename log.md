## Day 69: July 1, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on a .CSV parser to get card data into my 7 Wonders game engine. Refactored my solution to the "Bob" exercise on exercism.io.

**Thoughts** I've been thinking alot about how to find the right level of abstraction when solving problems with code. Easier said then done. Striking a balance between pragmatism, meaningfulness, readability and reusability is not easy.

## Day 67: June 29, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Found an excel file on boardgamegeek.com with all of 7 Wonders's cards' charateristics. Converted those to CSVs to use in my 7 Wonders game engine. Probably saved myself a few hours of work. Started implementing the game setup phase.

**Thoughts** I've been learning a lot live coding on Twitch and interacting with other devs. Makes me realize that I would probably grow much faster as a developer if I worked as part of a team for a while.

## Day 66: June 28, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Started work on a 7 Wonders game engine in Node.js. Had a great time on Twitch and got some good pointers from #sleeplessbytes and others.

**Thoughts** There is so much I have yet to learn but it's interesting how it seems to get easier and easier to take on new knowledge and concepts. The more I learn, the easier it is to learn.

## Day 65: June 27, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Optimized the remove and search methods of the Binary Search Tree in my collections library.

**Thoughts** I often end up coding in the morning and then again in the evening. Having to take 10 minutes every night to log my activity and post to Twitter is kind of a drag. Maybe I should just log after my morning sessions and include what I did in the PM the previous day.

## Day 64: June 26, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Optimized the insertion method of the Binary Search Tree in my collections library.

**Thoughts** Logging my activity everyday and posting it to Twitter is starting to feel like a chore. I'm trying to make my logs and posts interesting and it takes me too long to do. Going forward, I won't worry too much about because otherwise I'll find my self resenting it.

## Day 63: June 25, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Implemented the deletion algorithm for my binary search tree class. A little more complex than I thought, especially for nodes with 2 children, but it works like a charm.

**Thoughts** As I'm now seriously thinking about applying for programming job I find myself wondering what kind of projects I should pursue in order to showcase my abilities.

### Link(s) to work

1. [Collections](https://github.com/snowfrogdev/collections-ts)

## Day 62: June 24, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Started implementing the Binary Search Tree class. I got the insertion method done. Implemented a `Comparable` interface to make it flexible.

**Thoughts** Last day of the long weekend and frankly I can't wait to get back to my routine.

### Link(s) to work

1. [Collections](https://github.com/snowfrogdev/collections-ts)

## Day 61: June 23, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Decided to make my generic binary tree class into an abstract class. Binary search tree implementations will extend it. Found this [cool visualization library](https://visjs.org/). Looking forward to trying it to visualize the inner working of my data structures.

**Thoughts** Sooooooo tiiiiiiiirrrrreeeedd!!!

1. [Collections](https://github.com/snowfrogdev/collections-ts)

## Day 60: June 22, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Took a step back from WAVL trees and decided to implement a generic binary tree.

**Thoughts** I know I've said this before but this weekend really showed me that context switching sucks. It feels like coding for only an hour is almost like not coding at all. So I coded for two and half hours and went to bed late. Tomorrow morning is going to be painful.

### Link(s) to work

1. [Collections](https://github.com/snowfrogdev/collections-ts)

## Day 59: June 21, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Toyed with WAVL tree implementation.

**Thoughts** Barely got my hour of code in today... but I did.

## Day 58: June 20, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: After some further performance testing and research, decided it would be worth implementing a SortedMap and SortedSet backed by a binary search tree. They don't beat a hash table for sets and gets but they allow for more efficient range queries.

**Thoughts** I have a three day conference coming up and it's going to be a real challenge to get my coding in.

### Link(s) to work

1. [Collections](https://github.com/snowfrogdev/collections-ts)

## Day 57: June 19, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Tested performance of SortedMap vs JS built-in Map. I was thinking of maybe implementing a SortedMap using a binary search tree but when I compared other JS implementations against the buil-in Map it didn't look like there was any advantage to do that.

**Thoughts** Nothing much to say here today.

1. [Collections](https://github.com/snowfrogdev/collections-ts)

## Day 56: June 18, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Implemented Stack and Queue data structures in my Collections library.

**Thoughts** Considered implementing a Linked List but I don't really think there is a use case for it in JavaScript seeing how most popular JavaScript engines have super optimized the built-in Array.

## Day 55: June 17, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the Pythagorean Triplet exercise on exercism.io.

**Thoughts** Took the day off yesterday. Needed a mental break. Spent some time with friends and played video games.

## Day 53: June 14, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Solved the Sum of Multiples and Grains exercises on exercism.io.

**Thoughts** Solved Grains using recursiveness and the with math. Recursive functions are cool, but not the most performant.

## Day 52: June 13, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Solved the Luhn and Complex Numbers exercises on exercism.io.

**Thoughts** Complex numbers are indeed complex. Thanks to Khan Academy for helping me understand them a little better.

## Day 51: June 12, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Solved the Perfect Numbers exercise on exercism.io. Worked through chapter 12 of Bob Nystrom's excellent book [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com) and the interpreter now works with Classes.

**Thoughts** The debugger is like magic. It's amazing how you freeze time and travel through your code at your own pace while examining the program's state every step of the way.

## Day 50: June 11, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the [Last Crusade - Ep2](https://www.codingame.com/training/hard/the-last-crusade-episode-2) puzzle on codingame.com. Worked through chapter 11 of Bob Nystrom's excellent book [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com) which introduced a resolver for static scoping but it introduced some bugs and I have yet to figure out where the problem is.

**Thoughts** Debugging late at night when you're tired is useless... just go to bed, you'll figure it out in the morning.

## Day 49: June 10, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Started the [Last Crusade - Ep2](https://www.codingame.com/training/hard/the-last-crusade-episode-2) puzzle on codingame.com. Worked some more on the interpreter for the Lox programming language described in Bob Nystrom's excellent book [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com). Finished chapter 10 and the interpreter now deals with functions, including closures.

**Thoughts** Had a bit of a frustrating moment today when I couldn't get Rollup to behave the way I wanted to. JS tooling can be so frustrating sometimes. The lack of convention can be quite problematic at times.

## Day 48: June 9, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Worked some more on the interpreter for the Lox programming language described in Bob Nystrom's excellent book [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com). The interpreter now deals with if statements, logical operators, while and for loops.

**Thoughts** Have I mentioned before how much fun working on a programming language interepreter is? It's fun, so much fun.

## Day 47: June 8, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Barely got my hour in today. I beefed up my Array2D class by adding getIndices*Direction*Of() methods. I got the idea while working on the Last Crusade puzzle yesterday.

**Thoughts** I'm running into a weird problem with Rollup where it throws an error when I import a class from a file that is higher up the hierarchy than the package root directory. Will have to look into this.

### Link(s) to work

## Day 46: June 7, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Solved the [Last Crusade - Ep1](https://www.codingame.com/training/medium/the-last-crusade-episode-1) puzzle on codingame.com. Worked some more on the interpreter for the Lox programming language described in Bob Nystrom's excellent book [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com). The interpreter now deals with statements, assignement and scope.

**Thoughts** Gosh darnit! It's impossible to have an original idea anymore. I stumbled on this free online book by Bob Nystrom called 'Crafting Interpreters'. The book is relatively new, in fact it's not even quite finished yet. So I got this great idea: I'm going to write an interpreter for the little language he invented for the book (Lox) - I mean, how many people are even going to do that - and then I'm going to write an extension for it in VS Code.

I'm half way done with the interpreter and I'm about to test it on a .lox file  - .lox extension made sense but nowhere in the book does he suggest using that extension.

As soon as I create the file, VS Code displays a pop up that says there is an extension that can help with .lox files. At that point I'm thinking 'Oh, there must be some other kind of language or program that uses that extension', so I click on it out of curiosity.... Grrrr!!! someone beat me to it. And looking at the changelog, by about 5 weeks. This is almost depressing.

But I'm not giving up. The guy only did a syntax highlighter, I'm going to double down. That's right dberezin, I see your syntax highlighter and raise you a fullon language server, with autocomplete, error-checking, jump-to-definition etc... and then... a debugger.

## Day 45: June 6, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Solved [Closest Number](https://www.codingame.com/training/hard/closest-number) puzzle on codingame.com.

**Thoughts** Enjoyed pair programming with Steve Cramer. It is a learned skill though. At one point I kind of got lost and I guess I didn't communicate that clearly. It made keeping up with the rest of the coding session a bit of a challenge. That's on me. In the future, I'll have to make sure that we put on the brakes if I can't keep up, and not be afraid to look dumb because I'm not 'getting it'.

## Day 44: June 5, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Paired program with Steven T. Cramer again on the [Closest Number](https://www.codingame.com/training/hard/closest-number) puzzle on codingame.com. Worked some more on the interpreter for the Lox programming language described in Bob Nystrom's excellent book [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com). I'm writing it in TypeScript and it's running in Node.js. I also did a bit of work modifying a Ghost blog template for a local non-profit.

**Thoughts** I live coded on Twitch for about 1 hour and a half before I realized my mic was muted. I really need to come up with a pre-stream check list.

## Day 42: June 3, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Solved the [Skynet Revolution - Episode 1](https://www.codingame.com/training/medium/skynet-revolution-episode-1) puzzle on codingame.com. Had to debug a problem where the codingame engine would not deal with an iterator properly. Once I converted it to an array, everything worked fine. DO NOT USE ITERATORS IN CODINGAME. Also set up a test database for my Service Reporter project.

**Thoughts** Live streaming my coding sessions is a lot of fun when I get to engage with other knowledgeable coders.

## Day 41: June 2, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on customizing my Ghost blog's template. It uses [handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/) which I had never used but was easy enough to figure out thanks to the documentation and the fact that the syntax is very similar to the one used in Angular.

**Thoughts** Some creative avoidance today. There are a few projects that I have started, and a few that I really should start, that aren't as fun as some of the other stuff I'm working on right now but would probably create more value and I found a way to busy myself with other things. It wasn't a complete waste though, I did write a new blog post.

## Day 40: June 1, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Refactored my solution to the 'Space Age' exercise on [exercism.io](https://exercism.io). I used an enum to store some constants that I had spread out in several methods.

**Thoughts** I think I've said this before but ironically enough, I find it harder to get some coding in on the weekends than during the week. Something to keep in mind when planning my projects. I tend to think that I'll be able to spend a lot of time on my projects on the weekend but invariably I find myself busy with various social engagements and other responsabilities.

## Day 39: May 31, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Started the [Skynet Revolution - Episode 1](https://www.codingame.com/training/medium/skynet-revolution-episode-1) puzzle on codingame.com. It involves graph theory and the breadth first search algorithm. Also worked on making a Array2D class as I have noticed that many of the puzzle I work on involve the use of 2D arrays and I'm getting tired of reimplementing them everytime. The class extends the built-in Array class and adds methods to lookup items immediately adjacent to a given position, in each of cardinal and intercardinal directions.

**Thoughts** Forgot to log my activity before going to bed. Coding is fun... logging not so much... but I do see the value in doing it.

## Day 38: May 30, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the Pangram and Bob exercises on exercism.io. Pretty happy with my solutions. Instead of making a map keys representing every letter in the alphabet, I chose to iterate over the ASCII character codes with a for loop.

**Thoughts** So it's decided. I want to make programming my full time occupation, but I want to work remote. If I'm going to make a career change that involves taking a salary cut, I atleast want to have the perk of being able to work from wherever I want.

## Day 37: May 29, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Solved the [Rearrange string to two numbers](https://www.codingame.com/training/medium/rearrange-string-to-two-numbers) puzzle on codingame.com.

**Thoughts** I'm seriously starting to think about making a career change and going into programming full time. I love that s***!

**Today's Progress**: Started work on the [Rearrange string to two numbers](https://www.codingame.com/training/medium/rearrange-string-to-two-numbers) puzzle on codingame.com. Looks simple enough when you read the short description... do not be deceived.

**Thoughts** I love working on puzzles and algorithms but I find it harder to get motivated to work on some of my app ideas.

## Day 35: May 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the [Seam Carving](https://www.codingame.com/training/medium/seam-carving) puzzle on codingame.com. Learned a little about cron jobs while working on my service reporter app.

**Thoughts** I learned a lot about debugging and the VS Code debugger while working on this puzzle. I feel like I've come out of this a much stronger developper.

## Day 34: May 25, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Worked a bit on my service reporter app. Resisted the urge to pull in a front-end framework and instead learned how to use
`new URLSearchParams(window.location.search)` to access url query parameters.

**Thoughts** I hadn't worked on this repo in about 10 days. Context switching really is a b****, it took me longer than I thought it would just to figure out where I had left things and what to do next.

## Day 33: May 24, Friday

**Today's Progress**: On the road back from my workation for most of the day. Just had time to do a little bit of debuggind of my [Seam Carving](https://www.codingame.com/training/medium/seam-carving) algorithm. I also mentored a few exercises on exercism.io.

**Thoughts** This was the first day that I had to skip live streaming my coding session. I feel empty inside.

## Day 32: May 23, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Added the possibility to remove more than one seam at a time to my [Seam Carving](https://www.codingame.com/training/medium/seam-carving) algorithm. Had to spend some time in the debugger and learned how to use conditional break points.

**Thoughts** I'm learning to wield the power of the debugger more and more and moving away from console log debugging. It really is a powerful tool and quite enjoyable to use once you start to know what you're doing.

## Day 31: May 22, Wednesdday

**Today's Progress**: Made good progress on the [Seam Carving](https://www.codingame.com/training/medium/seam-carving) algorithm.

**Thoughts** Received good pointers on how to do TDD with more complex algorithms. One of the reasons I was having a hard time using TDD with this problem is that I started with complex test case inputs. By reducing the complexity of the input, it allowed me to implement the algorithm more gradually. For instance, instead of using a 100 pixels by 100 pixels image as input, I started with a 1 pixel by 1 pixel, and then 2 pixel by 1 pixel etc.

## Day 30: May 21, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the [Seam Carving](https://www.codingame.com/training/medium/seam-carving) algorithm.

**Thoughts** Today was hard. A lot of context switching and I couldn't figure out how to write some of my code using TDD. Spend two hours coding and not much to show for it. Very frustrating.

## Day 29: May 20, Monday

**Today's Progress**: So excited about this new puzzle on codingame.com. I have started implementing the main algorithm for [Seam Carving](https://www.codingame.com/training/medium/seam-carving).

**Thoughts** Really struggling with TDD. I like the idea and principle of it but I almost always find myself at a point where it seems to make more sense to implement something in a private method, which means I can't test it in isolation. I do the next best thing which is test the public method that calls this private method but it seems like the whole red green refactor cycle gets stretched and I end up writing way too much code before I get to run a passing test. This is even worse when my public method encapsulates an algorithm that is implemented in 4 or 5 different private methods.

## Day 28: May 19, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Fooled around with subclassing JS primitives. Also tried my hand at C# today on [cyber-dojo.org](https://cyber-dojo.org).

**Thoughts** Learning C# on cyber-dojo may not be the best idea as it's just a plain text editor. I think I might give it a try in VSCode or Visual Studio instead. Intellisense is a boon for discovering new Types and syntax.

## Day 27: May 18, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Completed Mine Field kata. Refactored to use a functional solution with small mapping and reducer functions.

**Thoughts** Man I love coding, but sometimes I get so frustrated when I have to task switch througout the day. Especially when working on solving more complex problems that involve math and algorithms. I hate having to stop midway picking it back up again later. I feel like I waste so much time reviewing what I had done previously.

## Day 26: May 17, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on mine field kata.

**Thoughts** I have a love-hate relationship with TDD. I like how it drives my design but at the same time I sometimes feel like I end up painting myself into a corner because of it. I too often realize, after working on something for an hour or two, that there is a much better design for what I'm trying to do and it wouldn't be too much work to just scrap my current solution and start from scratch but because of the work I put into building the test suite and the additional work required in building the new one, I stick with the not so great solution.

**Today's Progress**: Set up testing and debugging in VSCode for my codingame projects. F5 baby!!!

**Thoughts** The debugger in VSCode is truly amazing. Not necessarily the easiest thing to configure when you have special cases like running jest on TypeScript code but still, I'm impressed.

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the 'Bender - Episode 1' puzzle on codingame.com. Mostly refactoring stuff. Gave up trying to use the State pattern.

**Thoughts** These past two days have been rough. I get frustrated when I don't have enough time to code and I hate having to stop half way through something. Context switching is a b****.

## Day 21: May 12, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Added MongoDB connection and models using Mongoose and Typegoose.

**Thoughts** Getting my mandatory one hour of coding in is much harder on weekends. Still, pretty happy I haven't missed a day yet.

## Day 20: May 11, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Spent 2 and half hours mentoring on exercism.io but I guess that doesn't really count as coding. Started work on a tiny web app for my personal use. Played around with HTML forms and express.js server.

**Thoughts** Mentoring on exercism.io is a lot of fun. I think I learn as much as I help others doing it.

## Day 19: May 10, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the 'Bender - Episode 1' puzzle on codingame.com. Learned about the state pattern.

**Thoughts** The State pattern seems strange to me. On the surface it seems to encourage composition, but if you have many, many States that are similar to each other, you'll probably end up using some sort of inheritance hierarchy. Also, the tight coupling between the context and the states and between the states themselves makes me uneasy.  I could be wrong, I still have to play with the pattern to fully understand it.

## Day 18: May 9, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Solved the 'Order of Succession' puzzle on codingame.com. Got to use a tree data structure and depth first search algorithm. It had been a while. Also wrote up a blog article on the left shift bitwise operator.

**Thoughts** Writing blog articles really doesn't come easy. I can't help but feel that every subject has already been thoroughly written about. Yet, it does help cement in my mind things I have just learned.

## Day 17: May 8, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Solved the 'Bank Robbers' puzzle on codingame.com. Learned that `x * 2 ** y === x << y`.

**Thoughts** It was fun to get reaquainted with permutations and combinations equations. Some of the 'easy' puzzles on codingame.com are not all that easy.

## Day 16: May 7, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Solved the 'River I' and 'River II' puzzles on codingame.com. Used a `Set` to do some caching and optimise my solution.

**Thoughts** This was the first time where I really saw a use for JS' relatively new `Set` data structure. At first, my solution was doing alot of duplicate computation. I introduced a cache using `Set` and dramatically improved my solution's performance.

## Day 15: May 6, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Solved the 'Max Rect' puzzle on codingame.com. Ended up using the Hill Climbing algorithm I have been using on another project. Beats having to try to reason with 5 nested loops. Added WebWorker to demo of Macronutrients Optimiser.

**Thoughts** I really enjoy using these stochastic algorithms to solve problems. They are much more fun to code and use than pure brute force or mathematical algorithms. Why do all this hard worl to try to find the best answer when you can let the computer do the work and find a good enough answer. It's a very pragmatic way of solving problems.

## Day 14: May 5, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Built a demo of a small 'app' that uses my Macro Nutrients Optimizer algorithm.

**Thoughts** Working in pure HTML and TS without a framework was eye opening. We often take for granted what front-end frameworks do for us. I wouldn't want to develop an entire app this way. Still, for very small throwaway projects like this, going vanilla makes sense.

## Day 13: May 4, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Added early stopping to the Hill Climbing algorithm used in the Macronutrients optimizer. The algorithm will now stop if a certain time limit has been reached or if a result of a certain presicion has been reached. Also implemented a minimum weight for ingredients to avoid recipes where ingredients were set to 0 grams.

**Thoughts** The class is starting to get a little to be for my taste, I'm going to have to refactor soon as I keep adding functionality. I'm also going to have to implement some tests, didn't exactly develop this TDD style.

## Day 12: May 3, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Worked some more on the optimization problem submitted by [@DashBarkHuss](https://twitter.com/DashBarkHuss/status/1123733614108336128). I added the Random Restart meta-algorithm and am quite pleased with the results.

**Thoughts** Algorithms are so much fun. I can understand why people would want to work on games instead of web apps. I often feen like they are mostly about CRUD operations and very little interesting business logic. Tomorrow, I'll implement Stochastic Hill-Climbing instead of Steepest Ascent Hill Climbing, which is what I'm using at the moment, and see if it'll improve the results even more.

## Day 11: May 2, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on solving an optimization problem for [@DashBarkHuss](https://twitter.com/DashBarkHuss/status/1123733614108336128) and the ['Robbery Optimisation'](https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/robbery-optimisation) puzzle on codingame.com. Refreshed my understanding of the Hill Climbing algorithm.

**Thoughts** Both problems were a bit harder to solve than I initally thought. Sometimes you need to take a step back and really think things through. Watching me do a lot of thinking out loud and very little coding probably didn't make for the most interesting live coding session on Twitch.

## Day 10: May 1, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Worked through the 'Hamming', 'Scrabble Score' and 'Space Age' exercises on [exercism.io](https://exercism.io).

**Thoughts** 'Scrabble Score' was interesting. It was the first time I got to use a Map with keys of type Array.

## Day 9: April 30, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Finished the 'Allergies', 'Raindrops' and 'ETL' exercises on [exercism.io](https://exercism.io). Finished work on xmentor CLI.

**Thoughts** The 'Allergies' exercise was the first time I had to use a bitmask and bitwise operations. I'm glad I got to learn about it because I can see myself reaching for this in the future. Thanks to [gluegun](https://infinitered.github.io/gluegun/) I think making CLI tools has the dangerous potential of becoming like a drug to me.

**Today's Progress**: Worked through the 'Protein translation', 'Nucleotide count' and started the 'Allergies' exercises on [exercism.io](https://exercism.io). Started working on a CLI to automatically download and run tests on student exercises on exercism.io. I call it xmentor for now.

**Thoughts** I had fun working on these relatively simple exercises. I ended learning about TS index signatures. Making CLI tools is a lot of fun. I just love automating stuff.

## Day 7: April 28, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Made a mockup of QTsum, a Quentin Tarantino themed placeholder text generator inspired by [Jeffsum](https://jeffsum.com/) and started writing the html and css.

**Thoughts** I need to get better at CSS. It's the only tech where I seem to have a hard time remembering what does what. There's just so many options.

## Day 6: April 27, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Refactored the `new` command in Vts-CLI's using the Chain of Responsibility pattern.

**Thoughts** Implementing the CoR pattern was fun and I learned a lot. Hesitated between CoR and Builder pattern. Time will tell if I made the right choice.

**Today's Progress**: Started working on the LUMEN puzzle on [codingame.com](https://codingame.com). Pushed version 1.1.0 of Vts-CLI to NPM. Added the option to setup a web project using parcel as a bundler.

**Thoughts** Ran into some weird problems with the way Rollup seemed to output my TS code. Will have to look into that.

## Day 3: April 24, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Solved the 'Ghost Legs' puzzle on [codingame.com](https://codingame.com). Polished my Vts CLI project and published it on NPM (vts-cli).

**Thoughts** An interesting puzzle to solze. It took me awhile to wrap my head around the problem space but once I figured a strategy to solve the problem it was relatively easy to solve. Spent almost 20 minutes refactoring afterwards to make it more readable.

I used [Gluegun](https://infinitered.github.io/gluegun/#/) to make the CLI tool and it was a real pleasure to use. Very easy to learn and quite powerful. I'm looking forward to automating alot of stuff with this little tool.

## Day 2: April 23, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through the 'RNA Transcription' exercise on the Typescript track on [exercism.io](https://exercism.io). I've also worked on creating a small cli tool to generate Vanilla Typescript library starter code.

**Thoughts** The 'RNA Transcription' was a fun exercise. Though the problem was relatively easy to solve it gave me the opportunity to use some language features like `enum` and `type` that I haven't used much in the past.

I'm almost done with the first version of my cli tool. I'll add a bit of polish, refactor the code and then it'll be ready to publish to NPM.

## Day 1: April 22, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through the 'reverse string', 'triangle' and 'collatz conjecture' exercises on the Typescript track on [exercism.io](https://exercism.io).

**Thoughts** It feels nice to start a new challenge that will get me coding everyday. The fact that I'm logging everything on Github and stream on Twitch is great for accountability.
